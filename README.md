# Prediction-of-Heart-Failure-using-Logistics-Regression-Analysis
As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, heart disease is the prime killer of both men and women in the United States and around the globe. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. One person dies every 36 seconds in the United States from cardiovascular disease. About 655,000 Americans die from heart disease each yearâ€”that is 1 in every 4 deaths. Heart disease costs the United States about $219 billion each year from 2014 to 2015. This includes the cost of health care services, medicines, and lost productivity due to death. There are several data mining techniques that can be leveraged by researchers/ statisticians to help health care professionals determine heart disease and its potential causes. Some of the significant risk factors associated with heart disease are age, blood pressure, total cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, family history of heart disease, obesity, lack of physical exercise, etc. The objective of this project is to build a regression model and run statistical tests to assess how strongly are the clinical factors associated with heart disease and how it is related to the higher probability of getting a heart disease. We shall be implementing Multiple and Logistic Regression approaches together with the data. This project uses the Cleveland heart disease dataset.
